I built this project in order to use everything I liked about the `React` stack in one place. I am going to try to hit all the points for a Progressive Web App.

- [X] Use Babel and Webpack to leverage latest dev tools for easier development
- [X] React for Rendering everything
- [X] Redux for controlling the state of the App
- [X] React Router to handle the routing (both server and client)
- [X] Server Side Rendering: The process of rendering Client Side Components for faster 1st-request loads and also SEO
- [X] Code Splitting: Ability to lazy-load or asynchronously load components that the app doesn't need initially
- [ ] React Helmet for head tags for the <head>
- [ ] Service Worker Register for caching and offline

and then after that... implementing everything on [Google's PWA checklist](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist)
